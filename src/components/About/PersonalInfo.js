          I am a driven Software Engineer with a professional background in
          project management with a degree in Information Systems.

          To me, being a Software Engineer is more than just a job or career. I
          consider it an opportunity to showcase my technical skills and
          contribute to something much more significant, the future of
          technology.

          Inspiring the youth to never give up on their dreams has always pushed
          me to become a better programmer and human being. I believe that I am
          working towards making a change in the world; this is why I have
          become a Software Engineer.
